#To Do

- Twitter user @MOCallanain highlighted that the predicted tie rate is ~<0.2, when in actuality it's higher. Likely due to teams playing for loser point, can we parameterize the model to include a tie boost? 
- Prep playoff chance impact plots for Feb-April usage.
- Change DailySummary to post odds/rankings without game odds on days with no games.
